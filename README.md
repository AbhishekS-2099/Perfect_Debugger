# The Perfect Debugger

When your programs don't compile, what do you do?
When you can't figure out what went wrong, where do you go?
When your errors seem *just* out of your grasp, who you gonna call?

Introducing, the perfect debugger. 

Unlike those other Debuggers that are never completely reliable, we offer 100% error fixes.

Because you can't have errors, if your program file is empty.

To run The Perfect Debugger, clone this repo into your computer, and run the following lines in it:

```
./debug.sh <File to be debugged>
```
